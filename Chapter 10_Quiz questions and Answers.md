1. What does Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) combine?

A) Simple linear regression and multiple regression

B) Multiple regression and factor analysis

C) Path analysis and correlation

D) Cluster analysis and discriminant analysis

2. Which of the following is an advantage of SEM over traditional statistical techniques?

A) It only analyses observed variables.

B) It accounts for measurement errors in the model.

C) It uses fewer data points than multiple regression.

D) It cannot test for complex relationships like mediation.

3. In SEM, latent variables are:

A) Measurable directly using indicators

B) Abstract concepts measured indirectly through observed variables

C) Always measured through a single observed variable

D) Irrelevant to path analysis

4. Which of the following methods is commonly used to estimate parameters in SEM?

A) Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)

B) Maximum Likelihood (ML)

C) Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)

D) Logistic Regression

5. Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) is used to:

A) Test the relationships among latent variables

B) Test the relationships among observed variables

C) Validate measurement models and ensure reliability and validity

D) Perform exploratory data analysis

6. Which of the following is an indicator of model fit in SEM?

A) P-value from ANOVA

B) Standard Error

C) Comparative Fit Index (CFI)

D) Standard Deviation

7. What does a Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA) value of less than 0.06 indicate?

A) The model does not fit the data well.

B) The model has a good fit with the data.

C) The sample size is insufficient.

D) The model is too complex.

8. In path analysis, a direct effect refers to:

A) The relationship between two variables mediated by a third variable

B) The relationship between two variables without any intervening variables

C) The relationship between a latent variable and an observed variable

D) The effect of a moderator variable

9. Which of the following is a method for testing the validity of a latent construct in CFA?

A) Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA)

B) Cronbachâ€™s Alpha

C) Average Variance Extracted (AVE)

D) Goodness-of-Fit Index (GFI)

10. What does model specification involve in the SEM process?

A) Estimating the parameters of the model

B) Defining latent constructs and hypothesising relationships among variables

C) Testing model fit using indices

D) Ensuring model identification and estimation
