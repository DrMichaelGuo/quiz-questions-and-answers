3. What is the main difference between K-means clustering and hierarchical clustering?

A) K-means requires the number of clusters to be defined beforehand

B) Hierarchical clustering cannot use Euclidean distance

C) K-means is primarily used for large datasets

D) Hierarchical clustering is faster than K-means



4. Which clustering method involves creating a dendrogram to represent the data structure?

A) K-means clustering

B) Hierarchical clustering

C) DBSCAN

D) PCA-based clustering



5. What is the significance of the 'Elbow Method' in K-means clustering?

A) It helps to identify the optimal number of clusters

B) It is used to calculate the centroids of the clusters
