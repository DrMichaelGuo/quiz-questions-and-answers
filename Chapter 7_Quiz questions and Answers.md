1. What does a dependent variable represent in regression analysis?

 - A) A variable that predicts the outcome of the model

 - B) A variable that is predicted or explained by other variables

 - C) A variable that remains constant throughout the analysis

 - D) None of the above



2. Which type of regression is suitable when the relationship between variables is non-linear?

 - A) Linear regression

 - B) Multiple regression

 - C) Polynomial regression

 - D) Logistic regression



3. What does the p-value in regression analysis test?

 - A) The strength of the relationship between variables

 - B) The probability that the coefficient is zero

 - C) The variance explained by the model

 - D) The probability that the model fits the data perfectly



4. What does the Coefficient of Determination (RÂ²) indicate in a regression model?

 - A) The proportion of variance in the dependent variable explained by the independent variables

 - B) The change in variance for a one-unit change in the predictor

 - C) The total variance of the model

 - D) The residual variance in the model



5. Which regression method would you use to predict a categorical outcome?

 - A) Linear regression

 - B) Polynomial regression

 - C) Logistic regression

 - D) Ridge regression



6. What is the primary function of multiple regression analysis?

 - A) To predict outcomes using a single variable

 - B) To assess the impact of more than one independent variable on a dependent variable

 - C) To fit a polynomial line to the data

7. In logistic regression, what does the logistic function transform?

 - A) The coefficients into integers

 - B) The independent variables into dependent variables

 - C) The log odds into probabilities

 - D) The regression coefficients into p-values



8. Which regression technique is used when the data shows a curvilinear relationship?

 - A) Linear regression

 - B) Logistic regression

 - C) Polynomial regression

 - D) Quantile regression



9. What is the primary purpose of using an intercept in a regression model?

 - A) To adjust the slope of the regression line

 - B) To represent the expected mean value of the dependent variable when all predictors are zero

 - C) To increase the complexity of the model

 - D) To directly predict the outcome variable



10. What might a very low p-value (<0.05) in a regression analysis indicate about a coefficient?

 - A) The coefficient is not statistically significant

 - B) There is no relationship between the variables

 - C) The coefficient is likely to be statistically significant

 - D) The coefficient must be zero
